                    <p>Jira, developed by Atlassian, has become a cornerstone tool for project management and issue tracking. Designed with agile methodologies in mind, Jira helps teams collaborate, prioritize, and deliver projects efficiently. But what exactly does Jira offer, and how can teams leverage its robust features for agile workflows? Let's explore.</p>

                <section class="what-is-jira">
                    <h2>What is Jira?</h2>
                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p>Jira's name derives from "Gojira," the Japanese word for Godzilla—a nod to its origin story. At its core, Jira is a dynamic project management tool that supports various agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban. It empowers teams to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Plan and prioritize tasks</li>
                            <li>Track progress and resolve issues</li>
                            <li>Deliver high-quality products iteratively</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Jira's flexibility extends beyond software development to marketing, operations, and even HR teams, making it a versatile tool across industries.</p>

                </section>

                <section class="key-features">
                    <h2>Key Features of Jira</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Agile Boards: Scrum and Kanban</h3>
                    <div class="feature-box">
                        <p>Jira offers two primary workflows:</p>
                        
                        <h4>Scrum Boards</h4>
                        <p>Ideal for teams working in sprints, Scrum boards allow you to plan work for a fixed period (e.g., two weeks). Key elements include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sprints: Time-boxed cycles of work</li>
                            <li>Sprint Planning Meetings: Sessions where teams agree on tasks to complete</li>
                            <li>Sprint Backlogs: A prioritized list of tasks for the sprint</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Kanban Boards</h4>
                        <p>Perfect for continuous workflows, Kanban boards allow tasks to flow from "To Do" to "Done" without time-boxed sprints. Teams can visualize work in progress (WIP) and optimize throughput by setting WIP limits.</p>

                        <p>Jira's power lies in its adaptability. Whether you're running a small agile team or managing enterprise-level workflows, Jira provides the tools you need to succeed.
