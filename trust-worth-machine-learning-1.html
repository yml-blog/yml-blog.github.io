                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Machine learning (ML) has become a pivotal technology in various industries, driving innovation and efficiency. However, the trustworthiness of ML models is critical to their adoption and long-term success. In this article, we will explore the key aspects that make machine learning models trustworthy.</p>

                <h2>Key Aspects of Trustworthy Machine Learning</h2>
                <h3>1. Transparency</h3>
                <p>Transparency in machine learning involves making the decision-making process of models understandable to users. This includes clear documentation and the use of interpretable models.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Fairness</h3>
                <p>Fairness ensures that ML models do not exhibit biases against any group. Techniques such as bias mitigation and fairness-aware algorithms help achieve this goal.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Privacy</h3>
                <p>Protecting the privacy of individuals is paramount in ML. This involves implementing techniques like differential privacy to ensure that personal data is not compromised.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Robustness</h3>
                <p>Robustness refers to the resilience of ML models against adversarial attacks and data variability. Building robust models involves thorough testing and validation under various conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Accountability</h3>
                <p>Accountability in ML means that the outcomes and impacts of models can be traced back to their sources. This requires proper version control and monitoring of models in production.</p>
