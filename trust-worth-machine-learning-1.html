                <section class="key-points">
                    <h2>Key Aspects of Trustworthy Machine Learning</h2>
                    <h3>1. Transparency</h3>
                    <p>Transparency in machine learning refers to the ability to understand and interpret how models make decisions. This encompasses several key aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Model Interpretability:</strong> Using inherently interpretable models like decision trees or linear regression where possible, or employing post-hoc explanation methods like LIME and SHAP for complex models like neural networks</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Importance:</strong> Quantifying and visualizing which input features have the most impact on model predictions</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Maintaining comprehensive documentation about model architecture, training data, hyperparameters, and performance metrics</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>2. Fairness</h3>
                    <p>Fairness in ML ensures equitable treatment across different demographic groups. Key considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bias Detection:</strong> Using statistical measures like disparate impact ratio and equal opportunity difference to identify unfair model behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Implementing pre-processing (reweighting training data), in-processing (constrained optimization), or post-processing (threshold adjustment) techniques</li>
                        <li><strong>Protected Attributes:</strong> Carefully handling sensitive features like race, gender, age, and ensuring models don't create proxy discriminations</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>3. Privacy</h3>
                    <p>Privacy protection in ML involves safeguarding individual data while maintaining model utility. Key approaches include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Differential Privacy:</strong> Adding controlled noise to data or model parameters to prevent individual identification while preserving statistical patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Federated Learning:</strong> Training models across decentralized devices without sharing raw data</li>
                        <li><strong>Encryption Techniques:</strong> Using homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation for privacy-preserving model training</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>4. Robustness</h3>
                    <p>Robustness ensures ML models perform reliably under various conditions and potential attacks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Adversarial Defense:</strong> Implementing techniques like adversarial training, input validation, and gradient masking to protect against malicious inputs</li>
                        <li><strong>Distribution Shift:</strong> Testing model performance across different data distributions and implementing domain adaptation techniques</li>
                        <li><strong>Uncertainty Quantification:</strong> Using methods like dropout, ensemble models, or Bayesian approaches to estimate prediction confidence</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>5. Accountability</h3>
                    <p>Accountability ensures responsible development and deployment of ML systems through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Using tools like DVC or MLflow to track model versions, parameters, and training data</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring Systems:</strong> Implementing continuous monitoring of model performance, data drift, and system health</li>
                        <li><strong>Audit Trails:</strong> Maintaining detailed logs of model decisions, updates, and interventions for compliance and debugging</li>
                        <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> Having clear protocols for handling model failures or unintended behaviors</li>
                    </ul>
